"""Telling the user a music folder is wrong, while they can still fix it.

Two kinds of wrong, answered differently. How a folder is written is the
user's mistake and refuses the save, because nothing about it will improve
by keeping it. Whether it answers right now is not: a NAS switched off
tonight is still the right folder to have configured, and the library holds
what it indexed under a root it cannot currently see.

The credentials are the trap here. A password the user has typed but not
saved must reach the probe that judges the share, and must not reach the
resolver playback reads.
