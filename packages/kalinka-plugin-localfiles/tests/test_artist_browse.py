"""Tests for ``LocalFilesInputModuleDb.get_artist_orphan_tracks``.

Regression target: V/A coalescing anchors compilation albums to
``various_artists``, but the per-track artist tag still points at the
real artist (Wordsmith, Sam Garbett, …). The artist's "albums" view
correctly returns empty (their album is V/A), so the UI relies on
``get_artist_orphan_tracks`` to surface their actual track. The
predicate used to be ``album_id == 'unknown_album'`` — too narrow.
This test asserts the broader ``album.artist_id != track.artist_id``
predicate catches both cases.
