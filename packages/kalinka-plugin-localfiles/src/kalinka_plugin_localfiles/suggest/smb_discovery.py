"""Finding the file servers on this network.

Two ways, because no single one sees every server. Apple's and most NAS
boxes' shares announce themselves over mDNS as ``_smb._tcp``, which costs
nothing to listen to and arrives by itself. Windows machines and plain Samba
installs answer a NetBIOS node-status broadcast instead, which has to be
asked for and is therefore asked rarely.

Neither is allowed to hold up the settings page. What has answered so far is
kept here and handed over at once; a request for something fresher only
starts the next broadcast. The list is a starting point either way — a host
is not yet a music folder, because the share on it still has to be named.
