"""Where a music folder is, expressed as a protocol plus a location.

A configured music folder is either a path on this machine — including
anything the kernel has mounted there, an NFS or CIFS share as much as a
local disk — or a URL naming a service to talk to directly. The URL form is
``smb://[user@]host[:port]/share[/path]``, the spelling file managers and
``smbclient`` use; ``cifs://`` is accepted as the older name for it.

Locations are compared and joined as ordinary POSIX strings everywhere else
in this package, which is why the canonical form is built by hand here
rather than by :func:`os.path.normpath`: normalising a URL collapses the
``//`` after the scheme and silently turns a share into a directory name.
