"""Files on an SMB share, read over the protocol rather than through a mount.

Mounting a share needs privileges this service does not have and will not be
given: the unit runs with ``NoNewPrivileges``, which is exactly what stops
the setuid helper every FUSE filesystem needs. Speaking SMB2/3 from inside
the process needs nothing but a socket, and a share added this way needs no
root, no ``fstab`` entry and no packages on the appliance.

Shares the kernel *has* mounted are not this storage's business — they are
ordinary paths, and :class:`~.local.LocalStorage` reads them.

Locations are written ``smb://[user@]host[:port]/share/path``. Credentials
come from the module's configuration; the URL may name the user but never
the password.
