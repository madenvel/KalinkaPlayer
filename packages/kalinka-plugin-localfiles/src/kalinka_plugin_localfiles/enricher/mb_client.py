"""Paced access to the MusicBrainz web service.

Every MusicBrainz call in this package goes through :func:`mb_call`, which
owns the whole access policy: it spaces request *starts* one second apart
(MusicBrainz's published limit for anonymous clients) and runs the blocking
call in a worker thread.

musicbrainzngs has its own limiter, but it holds a lock around the request
itself, so concurrent callers execute strictly one at a time — pacing and
round-trip latency add up, and a request that retries a 5xx internally
(tens of seconds) freezes every other caller behind it. Since the enricher
now works on several entities at once, that serialisation was costing more
than the rate limit itself, so this module disables it and paces the starts
instead: the average stays within the published limit while round-trips
overlap. That makes this module the only correct way in: a caller that
reaches musicbrainzngs directly is no longer paced by anything.
