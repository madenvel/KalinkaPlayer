"""Artwork files on disk, in the three sizes every consumer expects.

One writer for the downloaded-cover layout (``<artwork>/<type>/<id>_<size>.jpg``)
shared by the indexer's embedded-art extraction and every enrichment source
that fetches covers, so the sizes and naming cannot drift apart.

Two ways in, because callers hold covers in two forms: a source that fetched
one over HTTP has bytes, while a sleeve scan found beside the audio has a
path — and opening that by path lets a large one be decoded without first
being held in memory whole.
