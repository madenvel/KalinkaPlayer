"""Tests for concurrent plugin setup in
``PreparedModuleCollection._scan_and_setup_plugins_from_entry_points``.

A slow plugin ``setup()`` (network login, web-bundle download, subprocess
spawn) used to serialise every other plugin behind it, delaying the server
from accepting connections. Setup now fans out with ``asyncio.gather``. These
tests pin down that the calls overlap, that results come back in entry-point
order (so the default-module choice stays deterministic), and that one
plugin's failure is isolated.
