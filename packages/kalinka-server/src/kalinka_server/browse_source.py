"""Everything a client may browse, whether or not a plugin provides it.

Browsing, name search and the vocabularies behind a filter are answered by
input modules *and* by the server's own built-ins — collections is one. Those
built-ins own no audio: nothing streams from them, nothing is suggested by
them, and the queue never resolves a track through them. Splitting the read
contract out of :class:`~kalinka_plugin_sdk.inputmodule.InputModule` is what
keeps a built-in from having to pretend otherwise.

An input module satisfies :class:`BrowseSource` structurally, so a plugin
declares nothing to take part.
