"""What a source can answer beyond the calls every source answers.

Browsing and matching a name are what make a source a source, so they are
not named here — only the optional halves are. A client reads the list to
decide which requests to make at all, rather than making one and learning
from an empty answer that it never needed to ask.

Each capability names one call, not a category. "Suggestions" would cover
both a semantic search and a recommendation drawn from what has been played,
and a source may well have one without the other.
