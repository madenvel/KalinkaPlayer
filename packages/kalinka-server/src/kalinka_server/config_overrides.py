"""User configuration overrides.

A single JSON file holds only the values the user has explicitly set,
keyed by the same dotted paths the ``/server/config`` PUT endpoint
accepts (``base_config.*``, ``input_modules.<name>.*``,
``devices.<name>.*``). Everything not in this file falls back to the
code defaults, so default-value changes ship cleanly with a new release.

Loaded once at startup and rewritten whenever the PUT endpoint mutates
state. Atomic-write via tempfile + ``os.replace`` so a crash mid-write
cannot leave a half-written file in place.
