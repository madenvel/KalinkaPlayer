"""The collections write API.

Reading a collection goes through the browse plane like any other source, so
nothing here answers a listing. What lives here is everything that *changes*
one — the half that has no place in a source's contract, because no plugin
implements it.

A write cannot degrade the way a listing does. With the file unavailable a
listing answers empty and the app shows an empty shelf; a write must say so,
or the app reports a collection nobody made.
