"""Playback sessions: a Core's exclusive claim on a renderer.

The Core mints the session id; both sides keep it in memory only, so a crash on
either side ends the session. A dropped link only suspends it — the renderer
keeps playing and the session is rebound when it returns. Whatever the two
sides then disagree about is settled by reconcile() at the next Hello:

    renderer reports        Core holds         outcome
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    our session S           S                  resume (rebind)
    our session S           nothing            SessionClose(STALE) to renderer
    another Core's session  -                  not ours; ignored
    nothing                 session T          T closed, RENDERER_RESTARTED

Reopening after a close is the owner's decision, never the pool's.

An open session is also the handle for driving the renderer: it carries the
playback commands (the AudioPlayer surface, one method per command) and the
state the renderer reports back. Settings are not here — they belong to the
renderer rather than to whoever is playing through it (renderer_config). Commands are not acknowledged — what one did
shows up in the state that follows, failure included. The single exception is a
command the renderer refuses outright because it names a session it is not
running; that comes back as a rejection and closes the session, which was
provably not there.
