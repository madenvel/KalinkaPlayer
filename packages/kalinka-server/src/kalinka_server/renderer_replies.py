"""Requests written to a renderer connection, waiting for the reply.

Two planes work this way — settings and upgrades — and both reach a renderer
that may reconnect underneath them, so a wait is keyed by the link it went out
on as well as by the message id it reserved. A socket that has been replaced
then neither answers nor fails what is riding on its replacement.
