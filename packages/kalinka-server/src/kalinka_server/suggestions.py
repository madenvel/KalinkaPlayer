"""Context-aware AI-search query suggestions (``/ai_search/suggestions``).

Serves N ready-to-run ``/ai_search`` queries matched to the moment — time of
day (morning coffee / afternoon focus / evening wind-down / night) and the
few public holidays CLAP can actually retrieve (christmas, halloween, …) —
and validated against the user's own library, so a christmas chip never
appears for a user who owns no christmas music.

The design is three stages, and only the first two cost anything:

  * **Candidate universe** — composed offline from piece tables below:
    per-daypart mood words and activity phrases crossed with a genre/instrument
    backbone, plus per-holiday full phrases. The vocabulary is restricted to
    what the retrieval stack is measured to handle (MTG-Jamendo benchmark:
    concrete genre/instrument strong; abstract mood words work only through
    the searcher's valence/arousal leg, so mood words come from that
    vocabulary). Negation — a known CLAP failure ("instrumental not rock"
    retrieves rock) — never appears by construction.
  * **Attestation** — a background job runs every candidate through the
    library module's public ``ai_search()`` and scores whether the results
    actually match the asked-for content: keyword agreement between the
    candidate's genre/holiday tokens and the returned tracks' genre + titles,
    damped by artist diversity. CLAP KNN *distance* is deliberately not used —
    measured to carry no relevance signal (it always returns nearest
    neighbours, relevant or not). Scores persist to the state dir keyed by a
    fingerprint of the library's embedding-done counts, so a restart serves
    from cache and only a changed library re-attests.
  * **Serving** — a pure in-memory lookup: resolve daypart/holidays, filter
    validated candidates by context, weighted-sample ``count`` of them.  One
    slot per response is *experimental*: context-matched but not validated,
    the serendipity outlet (and the only kind served for discovery sources
    like Jamendo, whose catalog matches anything). No model runs here.
