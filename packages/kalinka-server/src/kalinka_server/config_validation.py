"""Judging configuration changes before they are kept.

``PUT /server/config`` used to be a typed setattr and nothing more, so the
first thing to notice a misspelled folder or a port that is not a number was
whatever broke later. Everything a change can be wrong about is decided here
instead, in two layers: the declared type, which this module checks, and what
the type cannot say — that a folder exists, that a share names more than its
server — which only the plugin that owns the field knows and answers through
``validate_config``.

The verdict is advisory or binding by severity, never by who issued it: an
ERROR refuses the whole batch, a WARNING is reported and applied. Both reach
the settings page as the user types, through the same call the save makes.
