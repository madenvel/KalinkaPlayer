"""Presentation schema — display-side description of the settings UI.

The storage model (Pydantic config classes) is the source of truth for values and
validation. This module defines the separate *presentation* layer the backend emits
so the client renders unambiguously without re-mapping anything.

Authoring entry points:
    * Per-field via `Field(..., json_schema_extra={"widget": ..., "help": ...,
      "importance": ..., "setup": ..., "constraints": ...})`.
    * Per-config-class by declaring class attributes:
          __module_icon__: str          — material icon name for module cards
          __module_icon_color__: str    — hex color for icon tile
          __preview_fields__: list[str] — field names to compose the card subtitle
      Or by implementing::
          @classmethod
          def presentation_layout(cls, instance, prefix: str) -> list[SectionSpec]: ...
      for full control of section grouping. Note that such a layout is then
      the *only* source of fields for that subtree — a leaf it forgets to
      list is settable nowhere, expert search included — so prefer the
      auto-derived layout (one section per nested model, in declaration
      order) unless the grouping genuinely can't be expressed that way.
