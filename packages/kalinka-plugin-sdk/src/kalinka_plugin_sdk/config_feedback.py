"""What a plugin answers about its own configuration.

Two questions the server asks on behalf of the settings page. *What could
this field hold?* — :class:`ConfigOption`, offered as suggestions beside a
text field the user may still type into freely. *Is this value usable?* —
:class:`ConfigIssue`, the plugin's verdict on values the user has staged but
not yet saved.

Both are answered by :class:`~kalinka_plugin_sdk.plugin.PluginBase`, which
documents when each is called and what a plugin may do inside them.
