"""Shared text-embedding contract.

The server owns a single text-embedding model (one copy in memory — plugins
must not load their own) and hands it to every plugin through
``PluginContextBase.embedder``. The pair ``(model_id, model_version)``
identifies the embedding space. Plugins that persist vectors derived from it
(or ship indexes built offline) must validate both before use and treat a
mismatch as "recompute or disable" — vectors from different models, or from
different asset versions of the same model, are not comparable.

The SDK carries only this protocol; the implementation and its ML
dependencies live in the server. Added in SDK 1.2 — a plugin that requires
``context.embedder`` must pin ``kalinka-plugin-sdk>=1.2``.
