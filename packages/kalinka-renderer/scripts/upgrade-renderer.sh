# Run by the root-owned kalinka-renderer-upgrade.service when the renderer
# requests an upgrade. The renderer runs unprivileged and can only ask: it
# writes the version it was told to install into the trigger file, and this
# installs it.
#
# The installer is fetched from the repo rather than run from a package-shipped
# copy, so installer fixes reach a box without waiting for a renderer release —
# the same reasoning as the server's upgrade.sh. Downloaded to a temp file, not
# piped, so a truncated download cannot execute half a script.
