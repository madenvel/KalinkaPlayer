/**
 * @brief The two planes a Core connection talks to, shared by every connection.
 *
 * The session plane decides who owns the audio graph and carries playback;
 * the config plane says how the renderer is set up and needs no session; the
 * upgrade plane replaces the binary and needs neither, which is why a Core
 * that can no longer drive playback can still reach it. Bundled so that
 * adding a plane does not re-thread every constructor between main() and
 * CoreConnection.
