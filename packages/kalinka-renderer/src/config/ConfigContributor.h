/**
 * @brief One section of the renderer's settings, owned by whoever declares it.
 *
 * The player contributes its backend-specific section (driver, device, and
 * whatever else the sink needs); anything renderer-level joins by registering
 * another contributor with ConfigService — the schema grows by registration,
 * not by editing the config plane.
 *
 * ConfigService validates every write against the field it names before the
 * declaring contributor sees it, so applyConfig() never receives a path it did
 * not declare, a read-only field, or a value of the wrong shape.
 *
 * @note Called on the io_context thread; no locking.
