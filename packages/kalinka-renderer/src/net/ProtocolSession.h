/**
 * @brief What the bytes on one Core link mean — and no sockets anywhere.
 *
 * Runs the Hello/Welcome handshake, gates and routes session commands,
 * answers config traffic, and decides when a connection is not worth
 * retrying (protocol version rejected, renderer_id replaced). It hears about
 * the link through onUp/onMessage/onDown and talks back through the Wire it
 * is bound to; what carries the bytes is not its business — WsTransport in
 * production, a test's vector otherwise.
 *
 * While this link carries the Core that owns the session, it holds that
 * session and is attached to it: commands are gated here and routed in
 * through SessionEventSink, state comes back out through SessionTransport.
 * This class parses and frames; the session decides.
 *
 * @note Lives on the io_context thread; no locking.
