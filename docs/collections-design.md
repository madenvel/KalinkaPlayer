# Collections — design

A collection is a list of tracks the user assembled themselves, from any number of sources at once. Nothing else in Kalinka spans sources: an album belongs to the source that has it, a playlist belongs to the service that hosts it, and the library is the files on this machine. A collection is the one place where a Qobuz track, a Jamendo track and a local file sit in one order.

This document covers what a collection is, where it lives, and how it is reached. Reading is implemented on both sides, and so is the first write — making one. §7 is the editing that is still to come and §8 the rest of the write API it needs; the `EDIT` that starts it is drawn and disabled.

## 1. Decisions

### 1.1 A collection is a playlist

It is `EntityType.PLAYLIST`, under a source named `collections`. No new entity type: the app already renders playlist rows, unrolls them inline, searches them by name and offers the type as a filter, and every one of those works for a collection with no code that knows what a collection is. A fifth type would have meant touching each of those surfaces to teach it a concept the user does not distinguish — they made a list, and lists are playlists.

### 1.2 The server owns them, not localfiles

localfiles is the local-files library, and is likely to become a thin module over a media server. A list that spans sources cannot belong to one of them. It also cannot reuse localfiles' playlist tables, whose rows are foreign keys into the local track table — the one shape a mixed list can never take. Those tables and the playlist write methods go away with the write API (§7).

### 1.3 Read is a source; write is its own API

Reading a collection is browsing, so collections are a *browse source* (§2) and every read surface reaches them for free: the browse root, the Discover shelf, name search, the merged playlist listing, the filter vocabularies. Writing is not: a collection is the only editable thing in the system, so routing its writes through a contract every plugin implements would have every plugin declare methods only one of them means. The write API stands on its own (§7), and the read contract shrinks to what a built-in can honestly answer.

### 1.4 Entries are snapshots

A row keeps the track as it was when it was added — id, title, artist, album, duration, genres, cover — beside the id. A collection therefore reads back whole while a source is down, disabled or uninstalled, and only playback needs the source itself. The snapshot is not refreshed; a track renamed upstream keeps the name it was collected under until someone re-adds it.

### 1.5 `can_edit` is how a client knows

`BrowseItem.can_edit` sits beside `can_browse` and `can_add` and means: the server accepts writes that change what this item holds. A collection sets it (its tracks can change) and so does the shelf above them (which collections exist can change) — never a track, which is nobody's list. A client offers editing where it is set and never learns a source name, a type or an id convention. It is advisory — the write API refuses an id it does not own, whatever a client believed — and it does not promise a generic write contract: today `can_edit` and the collections API are the same thing.

## 2. Browse sources

`InputModule` is two contracts wearing one name: what a source *is* (listings, lookups, names, vocabularies) and what a source *has* (audio, suggestions, favourites, content). A built-in has the first and none of the second.

`BrowseSource` is the first half — `browse`, `get`, `search`, `list_filter_values`, `playlist_user_list` — as a `Protocol`, so an input module satisfies it structurally and no plugin declares anything. `BrowseSourceRegistry` holds the enabled input modules (resolved per call, so a source disabled at runtime stops being reachable) plus the server's built-ins.

Which registry a route uses is now a statement about what the route needs:

| Reaches every browse source | Reaches input modules only |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /browse`, `GET /browse/{id}`, `GET /browse/{id}/values` | `GET /ai_search` |
| `GET /get/{id}` | `GET /favorite/*` |
| `GET /search/matches` | `GET /content/*` |
| `GET /playlist/list` | queue track resolution |

Asking a suggestion or favourites endpoint for a browse-only source is an empty answer, not a 404: the source exists, that plane does not. A name nobody knows is still a 404.

`GET /server/modules` lists built-ins alongside plugins with `"builtin": true`, no config and no packages, so a client can search and browse them and skip the planes they lack.

## 3. Storage

One SQLite file, `<state_dir>/collections.db`, WAL, opened at startup and closed at shutdown.

```
collections   id, name, description, created_at, updated_at
entries       entry_id, collection_id, position, entity_id, source,
              title, artist, album, duration, track_json, added_at
entry_genres  entry_id, genre_id, genre_name
```

`track_json` is the snapshot and everything beside it exists to be queried — narrowing is SQL, not a filter pass over a loaded list. Track count and duration are subqueries rather than columns, so they cannot go stale. `entry_id` is what a write addresses: a track may appear twice, and a position moves.

A snapshot that can no longer be parsed is skipped with a warning rather than failing the listing: one row lost to schema drift must not cost the whole collection.

## 4. What a collection looks like

One record, two payloads on the same id:

- **As a playlist** — a row that unrolls in place, with `can_browse`, `can_add`, `can_edit`, the owner "You", `timestamp` being when it last changed, and a subtitle of its track count.
- **As a catalog** — a page under that same id, declaring the fields it can be narrowed by.

The item carries both because the two views are the same entity, and the filter contract hangs fields off a catalog. A client picks the payload its surface needs.

Every item states `can_browse` and `can_add` explicitly, even when the value is the default. Responses are serialised with `exclude_unset`, so a flag an item never set is absent from the JSON entirely, and a client reading it as a plain boolean fails on the whole listing rather than on that one row.

Its cover is the one a list of tracks has always had, not the wide background a catalog card sits on: `CatalogArtService` picks a style per item — `ArtStyle.COVER` for anything carrying a playlist payload, `ArtStyle.CARD` otherwise — and renders the cover as a square 2x2 mosaic of the first four distinct albums it browses, or that one album alone below four, since a half-filled grid reads as a mistake. Distinct is settled by the album an entry belongs to rather than by the URL of its cover — one album's tracks may each carry their own, Jamendo stamping the track id into the query — and then by the bytes that come back, since two albums may still wear one picture. Four copies of one cover is not a mosaic, so where fewer than four survive that test the first picture takes the whole square. The URL lands on both payloads, because the art is the entity's and not one view of it. A collection with nothing in it is skipped entirely, and so is one whose albums cannot be fetched: a mosaic is its albums and nothing else, so with none to hand there is no art to ship and the client draws its own stand-in.

Filters, declared per level:

| Level | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| The `collections` shelf | `q` over collection names |
| One collection | `q` over title, artist and album; `source`; `genre` |

`source` and `genre` are values fields offering `any` only — `all` and `none` are refused rather than ignored. The `source` vocabulary is the sources this collection actually draws on, named the way the rest of the server names them; the `genre` vocabulary comes from the snapshots, keeping the commoner spelling where two sources disagree.

Collections answer `search` for the playlist kind only. The tracks inside are the sources' own rows and are found there; a name search that returned them twice would be answering for someone else.

## 5. Playing a collection

The queue holds `TrackInfo` objects, each carrying the retriever made by the source that produced it, so playback of a mixed list needs nothing new — *once the tracks are resolved by their owners*.

That was the one real gap. `POST /queue/add` browsed a container and then asked the *container's* module for every track id it found, which is right for an album and impossible for a collection. `queue_add.track_infos_for` now browses the container through its browse source, groups the tracks it finds by their own source, asks each owner once for the distinct ids it owns, and reassembles the original order.

A source that cannot be reached fails the whole add rather than silently queueing what is left: a gap in the middle of a list the user is watching is worse than an error. A track a source simply does not return is left out, with a warning naming the count.

## 6. Where a collection is shown

Navigation is two levels — `Queue → Discover → Collections` — and a collection is not a third. The Collections screen is both the list and the detail: a collection unrolls in place there, the way an album or a source's playlist unrolls anywhere else. Nothing about a collection opens a screen of its own.

The app keys everything on the two flags the server sends and never on a source name.

- **`builtin` on a module** decides placement. The Discover root shows the built-in source's playlist shelf as YOUR COLLECTIONS above the EXPLORE CATALOGS rule, with its first few as rows, the count, and VIEW ALL; the catalog cards below skip built-in sources, and a built-in source carries no badge, like the local library. With no collections yet the section shows what a collection is and a live CREATE COLLECTION action. With no built-in source at all — an older server — there is no section.
- **`can_edit` on an item** decides what it is. On a row it means a collection: it unrolls with its own cover and summary rather than a source playlist's. On the open page it means the Collections screen itself, whose head carries `New` and `Edit`, and where the invitation stands when there are none. A write to that listing restarts it, the same way a filter change does.

The queue's own overflow is where a queue becomes a collection, and it is the one thing there that makes something rather than unmaking it: a card among plain rows, lettered in leaf green against the red of `Clear queue` below it, carrying how many tracks would be saved. The two ways of losing the queue moved under their own `CLEAN UP` heading, so the section that keeps is not read as part of the section that discards.

The Discover rows are shortcuts, not a second place to unroll: tapping one opens the Collections screen, scrolls to that collection, unrolls it and marks it briefly, so the jump reads as having landed somewhere; VIEW ALL opens the same screen at its top with everything closed; the play button on a row starts the collection without going anywhere. Returning to Discover restores the scroll it was left at. The root has to keep a settled height, which is the reason the shelf itself never expands.

An unrolled collection carries the same `Play all` / `Enqueue` pair a section of search results carries — one action reads the same everywhere, so both surfaces use the same two chips — and the pair stays through a selection: a header that came and went would move every row under it. What changes is its line, which reports how many of the container's tracks the selection holds instead of the tap-to-play hint that is no longer true. A collection row long-presses into the selection like every other container row, so a set can be gathered across collections and played or queued in one go.

A row says what the collection holds in one line — how many tracks, how long it runs — from `Playlist.track_count` and `Playlist.duration`, with the sources it draws on standing beside it as their own coloured letters from `Catalog.sources` rather than counted. The local library is lettered here, where every other row in the app leaves it unmarked as the default: what a mixed list is made of is the point of the line. An empty one says so instead of counting to zero. A collection with no mosaic yet gets the generated rings with the playlist glyph over them, the same tile the empty states use, and an empty one gets that tile even where stale art exists.

The "OR" left the divider: a section may sit between the entry and the rule, and the label has to read the same whether one does or not.

## 7. Editing, and where it will sit

Editing is a mode of the Collections screen, entered by its own `Edit` and covering every collection at once — the conventional shape (iOS Edit, Material's contextual selection), one toggle rather than a session per row. Making a collection is not part of it: `New` sits beside `Edit` in the screen's head and works on its own, because creating is a single write with nothing to stage. Both are neutral pills, carrying no berry at all. Berry has exactly two jobs (PALETTE.md, *Fill or outline*): a **fill** commits a decision — every filled button in the app is one, from Connect and Show results to the sheet's own `CREATE` — and an **outline** marks the one action a set leads with, or the row that is playing. A standing toolbar action is neither, and drawing it as an outline made it read as something already in effect. The one fill a screen at rest may carry goes to the empty state's `CREATE COLLECTION`, where making one is the only thing to do.

Inside a session, staged and reversible (built 2026-09-09): the toolbar becomes `Cancel` · `EDITING COLLECTIONS` over what is staged · `Done`, each touched collection carries its own `N CHANGES` chip and a `Reset` that clears only its staging, and `Cancel` confirms before discarding. Within one collection a row is dragged by its handle and marked to go by the round `⊖` at its head. Between collections, `MOVE` will open a destination sheet (the other collections, and `+ NEW COLLECTION`); the source shows `−1 moved to Sunday Morning`, the destination `+1 pending`.

**A row marked to go stays where it is, dimmed and struck through, until `Done`.** Pulling it out of the list on the tap would move every row under it by one, under the finger that has just been aimed there, and the mark is not a removal — it is a decision the session is still holding. The mark is a two-state circle rather than a tick box: sixty ticked boxes meaning *keep* is the wrong way round for a list where keeping is the default, and a tick that removes fights every other tick in the app. Marked, it becomes an `undo` arrow in `actionDelete` — the way back is the same control, in the same place.

**A staged change is amber, never berry.** Berry is for a decision being made or one already in effect (PALETTE.md, *Fill or outline*); a staged change is neither — it is waiting, which is what `statusPending` already means everywhere else in the app, from the reconnecting banner to the pending step. Only rows the user actually dragged are marked: a move shifts every row after it, and marking those would report the app's bookkeeping as the user's work. The one berry fill on the screen is `Done`, where the decision lands — editing is a decision surface, so the fill rule that keeps a screen at rest to none of them does not apply.

**`Done` confirms removals and applies moves silently.** A move can be moved back; a removal cannot, and nothing keeps what a collection drops. The dialog names what would go and from where — `3 from Night Drive · 2 from Sunday Morning` — so a session spanning collections is not confirmed blind. `Cancel` asks the other way round: anything staged is worth a question, since there is nowhere to get it back from.

**Dragging a track from one collection into another is deliberately not built.** No mainstream music app does it on a phone — Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube Music all use a "move to" sheet on touch and keep drag for a desktop sidebar that cannot scroll away. The reasons apply here: the destination scrolls out of view mid-gesture, and one gesture would carry two meanings (reorder within, move between) decided by a few pixels at the drop. The sheet says which collection it is going to, out loud, and costs one tap.

Adding is a single write too, and it is offered where the tracks are rather than from inside a collection: the queue's own overflow carries one `Save this queue`, which opens a **destination sheet** — the collections to choose from, `+ CREATE NEW COLLECTION` above them, a field to narrow a long list, and the two things that can be done with what is being saved. That sheet is the same one `MOVE` will open, so it takes what is being added rather than knowing where it came from, and every later entry point — a selection, an album, one track's overflow — reuses it by describing itself.

The second entry point is the **multi-select bar**, where a `Collection` button stands beside `Play now`. The room for it came from merging the bar's two queueing actions into one `Queue…` that opens a second stage in the same bar — `Play next` and `Enqueue`, behind a back chevron, over the count they would queue. Where in the queue something lands is worth asking only once something is being queued, and the bar is the narrowest surface in the app: three actions is what fits beside a count. The sheet takes the selection's ids as they stand, containers included — the server expands those exactly as `/queue/add` does, so an album taken whole need not be paged out first. A selection is only let go once the sheet reports something landed; closing it with nothing saved leaves the selection standing, to be sent somewhere else.

**Adding and replacing are one entry in the overflow and two buttons inside the sheet, not two entries in the overflow** (reversed 2026-09-08 after the first shape was built). The menu asks one question — where does this go — and the sheet asks the rest, which is the order the decision is actually made in: you pick the collection, and only then does it matter what becomes of what it holds. Two menu entries made the user commit to a verb before seeing a single collection name.

What made two entries look safer was that the same button in the same place would otherwise mean two very different things, one of them destructive. What carries that instead is that **the two verbs are two buttons under the list**, side by side: a berry-filled `APPEND` and a grey `REPLACE`. Only one of them is lit, so adding still reads as the default, and neither verb hides inside a state the sheet has to be put into first — the button that destroys is a tap away, and says so on its face. A replace onto a collection that holds anything confirms by name before it lands, which is what a one-tap destructive button is owed. A collection created from the sheet is always filled rather than replaced: there is nothing in it to drop.

Two shapes came before it (2026-09-08, 2026-09-09). A two-segment `ADD TO END | REPLACE` control made the additive case a choice to be made rather than the default it is, and gave equal weight to the one that destroys. A single unticked `Replace collection contents` box fixed the weighting but hid a verb inside a state: the one button below it changed meaning according to something ticked above, so the box had to be read before the button could be trusted. Two buttons say both verbs at once, and neither has to be remembered.

The room the box gave back goes to a **`Keep duplicates` switch**, drawn the way a setting is — label, one line of consequence, a pill toggle — because that is what it is: a standing choice about how the write behaves, not a third thing the sheet might do. Off, which is how it opens every time, a track the collection already holds is skipped and reported as already there; on, it lands again beside it. Both buttons carry it, since one batch can name the same track twice whether or not anything survives the write. It is safe to offer because a collection addresses its rows by entry id rather than by track: two copies are two entries with two ids, so a later removal or reorder can name exactly one of them — the same reason a playlist may hold a track twice.

Renaming and deleting a collection are single writes and do not belong in a staged session. Both hang off one **overflow** at the trailing end of an unrolled collection's action row (`⋮` while editing, beside the name), set apart from `Play all` and `Enqueue` because they act on the list rather than on its music. It opens a sheet of two: `Rename`, which opens the name sheet, and `Delete`, in `actionDelete`, which confirms by name and says what goes with it — a collection is its tracks, and nothing keeps them once it is gone. The overflow is deliberately not a control on every row at rest — both actions are rare, and a second button beside the chevron would compete with it for the same thumb while adding chrome to a listing that is mostly read. It was a pencil until deleting joined it (2026-09-09): a pencil that opens a menu holding `Delete` names one of the two things behind it. Reordering the collections themselves is out for now: the shelf orders by most recently changed and the table has no position column, so it is a schema change rather than a control.

## 8. Writes

```
POST   /collections                  create                      (done)
PATCH  /collections/{id}             rename                      (done)
POST   /collections/{id}/entries     add ids of any kind                     (done)
PUT    /collections/{id}/entries     replace with ids of any kind            (done)
PATCH  /collections/{id}/entries     remove and reorder by entry id          (done)
DELETE /collections/{id}             delete                                  (done)
```

`POST /collections` takes a name (trimmed; blank is a 422 naming the field) and an optional description, and answers with the browse id to go to and the name as stored — not the whole item, since the listing is refetched anyway and a new collection has no cover until something is in it. Names are not identifiers: two collections may share one. A write cannot degrade the way a listing does, so a file that will not open is a 503 rather than a success reporting a collection nobody made.

`PATCH /collections/{id}` takes a name under the same rules and answers the same reference. Its path carries the browse id, as every other id-taking route does, so an id belonging to another source is a 404 rather than a refusal — it names nothing here. A rename counts as a change to the collection, which therefore leads a listing ordered by when things last changed; a name that comes back unchanged is not sent at all.

`POST /collections/{id}/entries` takes ids of any kind and expands containers through the same helper the queue uses — what a client may add is whatever it may queue, and one helper knows how to turn an id into tracks. Each row keeps the track as the owning source last described it, minus its membership of wherever it was taken from. Genres are filed under the track's folded genre *name* rather than under the source's own id for it: a collection is mixed, two sources number the same genre differently, and the facet exists to gather them.

Tracks land at the end, in the order they were asked for. One the collection already holds is left out unless `allow_duplicates` says otherwise, a batch naming the same track twice counts as holding it from its first row on, and the answer says how many landed and how many were already there — enough to report the add without refetching. A track the source will not describe is left out rather than stored as a row that could never be read back. An id that is not a collection's, and a collection that is not there, are both a 404.

`PUT` on the same path means the collection ends up holding exactly what was sent and nothing it held: emptying and refilling are one transaction, since a write that failed halfway would leave the collection holding neither what it had nor what was asked for. It expands and snapshots by the same rules as the `POST`, and reads `allow_duplicates` the same way — nothing survives for a new row to duplicate, so there the flag decides only whether one batch may name a track twice; the answer says how many it now holds and how many it dropped. Replacing with nothing is refused — emptying a collection is `DELETE`, not a replace with an empty list.

`DELETE /collections/{id}` removes the collection and everything in it, answering `204`, or `404` for an id that is not a collection's or names none. Its entries and their genres go by the schema's own cascade rather than by three statements a failure could half-run. There is no soft delete and nothing to restore from: §9 rules out history, and a dialog naming what is about to go is what stands in for one.

`PATCH` on the entries is what a staged session commits: `remove` names the entries to drop and `order` the ones that survive, in the order they end up in, both by entry id. It is one request per collection and one transaction each, because a reorder that landed without its removals would leave the collection in a state nobody asked for. It replaces the `DELETE /entries` and `PUT /order` pair this section planned: two requests where a dropped connection could apply one, for a session that stages both together.

Between them the two lists must name every entry the collection holds — that is the whole point of sending the survivors rather than just the moves. A collection written to since the editor read it (another client's add, the queue saved into it) has an entry in neither list, so the write is refused whole with a `409` rather than dropping what the editor never saw. It is also why the editing list loads the collection outright rather than a page of it, and says so instead of staging anything beyond a thousand tracks.

A move between collections is a remove and an add of the same entry; committing a batch of those across collections at once still wants one request that either lands whole or not at all, which this one is not — it addresses a single collection.

Retired in the same change: `playlist_create`, `playlist_update`, `playlist_delete`, `playlist_add_tracks` and `playlist_remove_tracks` leave the SDK contract and their routes leave the server; localfiles drops its playlist tables; Qobuz drops its implementations; the template and Jamendo drop their stubs. `playlist_user_list` stays — listing a source's own playlists is reading.

## 9. Deliberate exclusions

Refreshing snapshots against their sources, exporting to a source, importing a source's playlist as a live link rather than a copy, smart or rule-based collections, sharing, and change events over the queue socket. One user, one app: the app refreshes after its own writes.

Sort order beyond "most recently changed first" is also out. The filter contract has text and values fields and no ordering facet, and adding one for this would be a contract change earning a single listing.
